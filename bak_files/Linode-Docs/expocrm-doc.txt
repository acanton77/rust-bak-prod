===========
OUTDATED

For conversion to 7.x:

Keep www-data:www-data (33 and 33) in config.

Change dir to espo root directory:
Code:

cd /path/to/espo

All files and dirs should be www-data:www-data (always be cautious with chown to not to screw up the system by applying ownership to a wrong directory):

Code:
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data .  (note the period... must have... 'this dir'


Delete file data/config-internal.php:

Code:
rm data/config-internal.php

Run upgrade from www-data:
Code:
sudo -u www-data php command.php upgrade

We always run upgrade from www-data user otherwise we would have had mixed ownerships like you have (unless we run from root, cause root can change ownership).

Before v7.0 Espo was tolerant to failing to set ownership that is set in config. Now it throws an exception if it can't set required permissions.

====================

For crontab:

Command is:

NEW: run every 30 min for test:

30 * * * * cd /var/www/html/mailanc2.net/public_html/espocrm2; /usr/bin/php -f cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1


* * * * * cd /var/www/html/mailanc2.net/public_html/espocrm2; /usr/bin/php -f cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1

It must be entered in the crontab for user: www-data

sudo crontab -l -u www-data

sudo crontab -e -u www-data

If you want any scripts to be run in www-data crontab (above) from /home/anc1 those scripts probably have to have www-data as the 'group' when now they have 'anc1'
